I purchased my first cryptocurrency in 2015, just before my first college semester started in NUS. It wasn't for investing, i wanted to use the bitcoin to purchase modafanil. Modafinil was only starting to pick up steam then and if i purchased using bitcoin, i could get a 20% discount. Seems like a no brainer to me.


I'll have a post about modafinil on another day - today's one is about bitcoin.


Bitcoin was less than 1k when i purchased it - it was about 500 Singaporean Dollars. Yet i felt that that was too expensive for some 'fake internet money'. How wrong i was. I wish that i purchased hundreds more of bitcoin instead on splurging my money on wasteful things.


2017 was an amazing year from cryptocurrency. Ethereum went up from 7$ to almost 780$ and of this time of writing, it has already went up to USD$1000.


2018 will be a great year for cryptocurrency - and my favourite coins NAVcoin is poised for a massive bullish run. I expect no less than $30 by the end of Q1, and possibly even $100 by the end of year.


NAVCoin is currently a currency, but it will soon evolve into a platform like ethereum/neo/waves. This means that future decentralized applications can be built on top of the NAVChain protocol, and unlike ethereum where contracts are written exclusively in solidity, NAVChain will support popular languages such as Java for starters.


The dev team already has a working prototype and but the details are still kept under wraps - and the whitepaper has been in internal review for a almost 2 months. Expect the whitepaper to be released soon, possibly within January.


However, unlike the ethereum virtual machine, NAVChain will support anonymity. As far as I know, there are no other anonymous decentralized application (aDapps) platform currently available. Only ONE other cryptocurrency has aDapps also planned - ENIGMA(ENG), where the whitepaper for the aDapps platform was released last week. Of course Ethereum will also be applying ZK-Snarks, but that will be sometime in the future.


Beyond the release of the aDapps whitepaper, polymorph is slated to be released in Q2 2018. Polymorph is similar to atomic swaps where users will be able to swap any coin by using NAVCoins as an intermediary chain - meaning anonymity will be supported. 


The marketing roadmap will also be released soon.


If you are only concerned about the market prices:


Enigma's release of their own aDapps whitepaper has resulted in the price of the coin to shoot up from $2 to 7$ in a day - thats a 3.5x increase. Navcoin will be releasing a whitepaper + working prototype, it will be safe to assume that the price of navcoin will grow by at least 400% putting its price at $15.


Marketing roadmaps almost always increases the price by at least 50%.


In addition, the upbit listing which has already been confirmed with a korean won pair will at least increase NAVCoin prices by another 50%.


If all of these conditions can be met, i do not expect NAV to be below 20$ by the end of Q1 2018.


Happy investing everybadi
